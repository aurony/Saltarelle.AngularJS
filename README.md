# Saltarelle.AngularJS

Angular.JS for the Saltarelle C# compiler. 

## About

Saltarelle.AngularJS is a library written for the [Saltarelle](www.saltarelle-compiler.com) C#-to-javascript compiler that allows to 
use the [AngularJS](angularjs.org) framework from the C# language, making it possible to write C# client side web applications.

Other than providing an interface to AngularJS, the library also makes Angular more C# friendly, trying to make it look
as if it was designed for C# and not Javascript.

## Current state

As of now, only the main features of the latest angular release are covered, tough more and more are costantly added.
