      <h1>Accordion/Expander directives example:</h1>
      <i>
         Premise: writing directives with Angualar is a very wide and complex subject. Don't expect to understand everything.
      </i>

      <ul>
         <li>'Expander' is a clickable control that shows/hides its content. It has a title and a content.</li>
         <li>'Accordion' holds a collection of expanderss, and when one is expanded, all the others in the collection are collapsed.</li>
         <li>
            When created, 'Expander' looks for the accordion controller in the parent chain and register itself into it,
            so that accordion can keep a list of expanders. For such purpose, the accordion controller is passed as argument in the expander Link function.
         </li>
         <li>
            When expander is clicked, it toggles itself and notifies the accordion controller so that he can collapse all the other expanders.
         </li>
         <li>
            Both directives have their own separate controllers. Such controllers  are available in the $scope object as field members
            (the "controller as" syntax, e.g. $scope.ctrl)
         </li>
         <li>
            Controllers can access the $scope object because it can be injected.
         </li>
      </ul>

      <accordion>
         <expander expander-title="title1">this is expander content 1</expander>
         <expander expander-title="title2">this is expander content 2</expander>
         <expander expander-title="title3">this is expander content 3</expander>
         <expander expander-title="title4">this is expander content 4</expander>
         <expander expander-title="title5">this is expander content 5</expander>
         <expander expander-title="title6">this is expander content 6</expander>
      </accordion>
